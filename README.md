A grid of Cubes, floating like water

Floating Cubes is written in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/), which is a library that allows you to use Processing Syntax in Javascript.

## How it works

- The cubes are objects
- The grid of cubes is a two-dimenaional array
- The wave-patterns are generated with two-dimensional [perlin noise](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise) 

## The idea

I got the idea from this [gametrailer (Bound)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTNC3MUtzlo). I wanted a version of the floating cubes without clipping. :)
