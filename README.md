Floating Cubes is written in [P5JS](https://p5js.org/), which is a library that allows you to use Processing Synthax in Javascript.

## How it works

- The cubes are Objects
- The grid of cubes is a two-dimenaional array
- The wave-patterns are generated with two-dimensional [perlin noise](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/noise)
